#Athena Fitness

Browsing through websites promising fitness classes only to find out that they are paid to watch? Or manually searching the names of your target exercise on Youtube every time you start a workout session? 
Yes, been there too.

# What it does?
Athena Fitness is a completely free (& ad free too) web app that allows you to browse your favourite workouts based on target muscles with steps and direct links to Youtube.
